    <p>
        A generic website for courses, built by Dr. Eugene
        Callahan, Tirupal Ravilla, Snehal Kenjale, Vishal Tyagi, Avi Patel 
        and Vrajesh Mehta.
    </p>
    <p>
        The course is built using
        <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a>
        and other
        <a href="https://github.com/gcallah/CourseBuilder/tree/master/docker/requirements.txt">
            open source tools
        </a>
        and is itself an 
        <a href="https://github.com/gcallah/CourseBuilder">
            open source project.
        </a>

        The requirements for a A-quality course project are:
    </p>
    <ol class="nested">
        <li>
            The project strictly follows the DRY principle: everything that
            must appear in multiple places in the project has a single
            source.
        </li>
        <li>
            All aspects of the project are under version control, including
            source, build scripts, graphics, documentation, and anything
            else related to the project.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make sure to test changes locally before committing.
        </li>
        <li>
            The project has automated testing with over 50% test coverage,
            and, if web-based, has Selenium tests.
        </li>
        <li>
            All of your code should pass a lint tool for the language
            you are using.
        </li>
        <li>
            For any aspects of the project that are built, there is an
            automated build process.
        </li>
        <li>
            Developers can work in a Docker container for development,
            and deploys can be done via a container. Furthermore, the 
            containers themselves are built by scripts, not by hand.
        </li>
        <li>
            The project can successfully be deployed to the cloud.
        </li>
        <li>
            There is monitoring in place for the project.
        </li>
    </ol>
